============= PROJECT LOGS ==============

Hello!

Thank you for embarking on this journey with me for this project. I know it's not pretty as of now /but/ I still want to show you what I've done so far.

I received 8 responses so far for this project. I used way too much time waiting for more responses rather than implementing what I had. The site is "functional" as in each time slot works but only one result shows.

I want to keep a simple theme as of now ( monochromatic ). I'll dive into fonts and shades once all data is entered into the sheet and responses are viewable to users.

From there, I'm going to create a survey so I can collect data more efficiently. I'll experiment with the UX while gathering responses.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hi!

Now Project Oswald is on GitHub and online!! You can access Oswald at https://elizboahen.github.io/Project_Oswald/index.html

I've also gone through and removed typos, linking issues, and added a CSS theme file which changed the font and animated the homepage. The survey can also be accessed here: https://forms.gle/Tgjw72CeAoe6MwUu9

My next step is to add the CSS to every page, add all survey data, and add a project statement.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hi there,

I'm jumping back into this project.

I aim to make minor edits ( indentation, cleaning up code, etc.). With the current state of the world, the data collected looks even stranger. Everything was once so normal. I wish I collected more responses, but I did what I could at the time.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hello again,

I'm returning to this project to change the "is" to "someone was" in order to make the sentences flow better but also because those are no longer present realities.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hi,

I'm back to change the "is" to "someone was" and make the columns of text consistent.

I figured out how to turn on Spellcheck on default. This whole time I thought when I turned on Spellcheck, every file's spelling would be checked. Once I made this setting a default. I saw many errors I missed. Thank goodness I figured this out.

Best wishes,
Eli
