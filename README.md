Hello!

Thank you for embarking on this journey with me for this project. I know it's not prety as of now /but/ I still want to show you what I've done so far.

I received 8 responses so farfor this project. I used way too much time waiting for more responese rather than implementing what I had. The site is "funtional" as in each time slot works but only one result shows.

I want to keep a simple theme as of now ( monochromatic ). I'll dive into fonts and shades once all data is entered into the sheet and responses are viewable to users.

From there, I'm going to create a survey so I can collect data more efficently. I'll experiment with the UX while gethering responses.

Best wishes,
Eli
