============= PROJECT LOGS ==============

Hello!

Thank you for embarking on this journey with me for this project. I know it's not prety as of now /but/ I still want to show you what I've done so far.

I received 8 responses so farfor this project. I used way too much time waiting for more responese rather than implementing what I had. The site is "funtional" as in each time slot works but only one result shows.

I want to keep a simple theme as of now ( monochromatic ). I'll dive into fonts and shades once all data is entered into the sheet and responses are viewable to users.

From there, I'm going to create a survey so I can collect data more efficently. I'll experiment with the UX while gethering responses.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hi!

Now Project Oswald is on GitHub and online!! You can acess Oswald at https://elizboahen.github.io/Project_Oswald/index.html

I've also gone through and removed typos, linking issues, and added a CSS theme file which changed the ont and animated the homepage. The survey can also be acessed here: https://forms.gle/Tgjw72CeAoe6MwUu9

My next step is to add the CSS to every page, add all survey data, and add a project statement.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hi there,

I'm jumping back into this project.

I aim to make minor edits ( indentation, cleaning up code, etc.). With the current state of the world, the data collected looks even stranger. Everything was once so normal. I wish I collected more responses, but I did what I could at the time.

Best wishes,
Eli

Hello again,

I'm returning to this project to change the "is" to "someone was" in order to make the sentences flow better but also becuase those are no longer present realities.

Best wishes,
Eli
