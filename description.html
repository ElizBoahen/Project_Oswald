		<h3>Project Oswald was initiated by Elizabeth Boahen in response to the distortion of normalcy. The state of the world has halted the gears of everyday life and blurred the line between today and tomorrow. Project Oswald asks volunteers to describe their Monday before the shift and lets others look back on a norm that once was.</h3>

		<h2>Monday was a mocked day of the week. Synonymous with the start of a work week or school. Post weekend grogginess. The raincloud of weekdays. For many, now Monday is simply a day. Another marker of the passing of time. Now the morning coffee for a commute is no longer a norm but a shard of nostalgia. </h2>
